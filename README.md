# Parallel Gaussian process with kernel approximation in CUDA

CUDA implementation of Gaussian process with approximated kernel. The mathematical formulation was originally presented in [V. Joukov and D. KuliÄ‡ (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09848).
### Requirements
* `gcc` v9.4.0
* `CUDA` toolkit v12.3
* `CMake` >= v3.18
* Eigen3 v3.4
* Matlab/Octave
The code is tested in Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. Figures are generated in Matlab R2022a. Octave 5.2.0 is also supported.
### Building the executables
In the desired folder, clone this repository:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:DavideCarminati/cuFAGP.git
```
Then `cd` in the folder and build the executables with CMake:
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
Executables are located in the `build` folder.
### Run the example script
Once executables are built, run in the terminal:
```sh
cd ..
source example.sh
```
to replicate the results in the paper.
